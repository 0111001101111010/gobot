    %p
      The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller,
      and a bit less powerful. With a whole host of shields to extend its functionality and the ability to
      use the familiar Arduino IDE the Digispark is a great way to jump into electronics, or perfect for when
      an Arduino is too big or too much.

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to install
    %p
      Installing Gobot with digispark support is pretty easy.

          :::bash
          go get -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-digispark
    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program lets you toggle an LED on and off.
    :markdown
          :::javascript
          package main

          import (
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-digispark"
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-gpio"
            "fmt"
          )

          func main() {

            digispark := new(gobotDigispark.DigisparkAdaptor)
            digispark.Name = "Digispark"

            led := gobotGPIO.NewLed(&digispark)
            led.Driver = gobot.Driver{
              Name: "led",
              Pin: "2",
            }

            connections := []interface{} {
              digispark,
            }
            devices := []interface{} {
              led,
            }

            work := func(){
              gobot.Every("0.5s", func(){ 
                led.Toggle() 
                if led.IsOn() {
                  fmt.Println("On")
                } else {
                  fmt.Println("Off")
                }
              })
            }
            
            robot := gobot.Robot{
                Connections: connections, 
                Devices: devices,
                Work: work,
            }

            robot.Start()
          }

    %h2 How to connect
    %p
      If your Digispark (
      %a{ href:"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-the-tiny-arduino-enabled-usb-dev-board"} http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-the-tiny-arduino-enabled-usb-dev-board
      ) ATTiny-based USB development board already has the Little Wire (
      %a{ href:"http://littlewire.cc/"} http://littlewire.cc/
      ) protocol firmware installed, you can connect right away with Gobot.

    %p
      Otherwise, for instructions on how to install Little Wire on a Digispark check out

  %section.drivers
    %h2 Drivers
    %p
      Thanks to
      %b Gobot
      and
      %b go
      it is possible to interact with several I/O hardware devices and interfaces connected to the digispark
      using a set of already defined and easy to use drivers, all of this thanks to the Gobot architecture,
      in conjuction with gobot-digispark adaptor (using the littlewire communication protocol),
      which makes it even possible to swap the entire platform for something else like arduino,
      and keep using the same code you just wrote for digispark, this just by swapping a couple
      of lines in your program.
    %p
      Available drivers for the digispark platform are listed below, the drivers contain detailed documentation and examples of what kind
      physical computing (using Gobot and Go) you could be doing:
