%h2 About
%p 
  Gobot is set of libraries in the 
  =link_to "Go programming language", "http://golang.org/", target: "_blank" 
  for robotics and physical computing.

%p It provides a simple, yet powerful way to create solutions that incorporate multiple, different hardware devices at the same time.

%h2  Meet The Code

%p Gobot makes commanding robots incredibly simple and fun.

%p All you need to get started is install the library with :  
:markdown
  `go get -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot`.

%p Then install additional libraries for whatever hardware support you want to use from your robot. For example, `go get -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-sphero` to use Gobot with a Sphero.

%h2  Example
:markdown
      :::go
      package main

      import (
        "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
        "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-sphero"
      )

      func main() {

        spheroAdaptor := new(gobotSphero.SpheroAdaptor)
        spheroAdaptor.Name = "Sphero"
        spheroAdaptor.Port = "/dev/rfcomm0"

        sphero := gobotSphero.NewSphero(spheroAdaptor)
        sphero.Name = "Sphero"

        work := func() {
          gobot.Every("2s", func() {
            sphero.Roll(100, uint16(gobot.Rand(360)))
          })
        }

        robot := gobot.Robot{
          Connections: []interface{} { spheroAdaptor },
          Devices:     []interface{} { sphero },
          Work:        work,
        }

        robot.Start()
      } 

%h2 Hardware Support
%p
  Gobot has a extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following robotics and physical computing platforms are currently supported:
  %ul
    %li
      = link_to "Arduino", "http://www.arduino.cc/", target:"_blank" 
      &lt;==&gt;
      = link_to "Library", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-firmata", target:"_blank" 
    %li
      = link_to "Beaglebone Black", "http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone+Black/", target:"_blank" 
      &lt;==&gt;
      = link_to "Library", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-beaglebone", target:"_blank" 
    %li
      = link_to "Digispark", "http://digistump.com/category/1", target:"_blank"  
      &lt;==&gt;

      &lt;==&gt;
      = link_to "Library", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-sphero", target:"_blank" 

%p Support for many devices that use General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) have a shared set of drivers provded using the cylon-gpio module:
%ul
  %li
    = link_to "GPIO", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output" , target:"_blank" 
    &lt;==&gt;
    = link_to "Drivers", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-gpio" , target:"_blank"
    %ul 
      %li Button
      %li LED
      %li Servo 

%p Support for devices that use Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) have a shared set of drivers provded using the gobot-i2c module:
%ul
  %li
    = link_to "I2C", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" , target:"_blank" 
    &lt;==&gt;
    = link_to "Drivers", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-i2c" , target:"_blank"
    %ul 
      %li Wii Nunchuck Controller


%p More platforms and drivers are coming soon...

%h2 Getting Started

:markdown
  Install the library with: `go get -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot`
:markdown
  Then install additional libraries for whatever hardware support you want to use from your robot. For example, `go get -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-sphero` to use Gobot with a Sphero.

  =link_to "Get Started Here!", "", (menu_item("documentation/getting-started"))

%h2 API
%p Gobot includes a RESTful API to query the status of any robot running within a group, including the connection and device status, and execute device commands.

:markdown
  To activate the API, use the `Api` command like this:

      :::bash
      master := gobot.GobotMaster()
      gobot.Api(master)

  To specify the api port run your Gobot program with the `PORT` environment variable

      :::bash
      $ PORT=8080 go run gobotProgram.go
