Continuing our robot road show in recognition of [National Robotics Week](http://nationalroboticsweek.org), we brought Gobot ([http://gobot.io](http://gobot.io)) our Golang robotics framework, to Boston to speak to [BostonGolang](http://bostongolang.org/). Boston has a thriving technology community, and we were happy to speak to one of the new but quickly growing meetup groups focusing on our favorite language, Go. 

Held at Akamai's offices in Cambrige, we had just introduced our new "10 Rules Of Robot Ops" site earlier in the day, so we used that as the theme for the talk. We had also just finished support for the [Neurosky Mindwave Mobile EEG](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile), and it was neat to incorporate Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). We also demoed our Golang powered version of Conway's Game of Life using [Sphero](hhttp://www.gosphero.com) robots.

Thanks to all of you who came out to see us, we had a great time sharing our latest work with Boston's Golang community of enthsuiasts!
